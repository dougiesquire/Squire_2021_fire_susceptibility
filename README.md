Notebooks are numbered according to the order in which they should be run.

Figures are generated in the following notebooks:
 - **Fig 1**: `0_get_region.ipynb`
 - **Fig 2**: `3_historical_precedent.ipynb`
 - **Fig 3**: `4_fidelity_testing.ipynb`
 - **Fig 4**: `4_fidelity_testing.ipynb`
 - **Fig 5**: `5_likelihoods.ipynb`
 - **Fig 6**: `6_conditioning.ipynb`
 - **Fig 7**: `6_conditioning.ipynb`
 - **Fig 8**: `5_likelihoods.ipynb`

To clean up before publishing:
 - remove figure checks from `1.0_prepare_index_data.ipynb` comparing old and new data
 - keep only PBSCluster code cells
 - decide whether including masking of dt or not and edit code accordingly
